# CS-584-Enterprise-Web-Applications

# Course Description
This course discusses the architectures, design methodologies, and
technologies used in the Full-Stack development of the object-oriented
enterprise web applications. Multitier architectures, application servers,
microservices, multithreading and concurrency, client-server model and
MVC architecture will be discussed and analyzed. The course also discusses
the application architecture, and the design process to extract, transform,
and load data for document-oriented, relational, and graph database
systems. Analyze and discuss the data pipeline process utilized for data
collection and the creation of the data analytics reports used in effective
business process management for the enterprise, Time-series forecasting for
strategic planning, marketing campaigns, sentiment analysis, and focused
advertisement. This course reviews the widely used user experience (UX)
and user interface (UI) design patterns, and information architectures for
usability engineering. The course demonstrates how usability engineering is
applied in the iterative and agile software development processes to verify
the quality of the software product with respect to ease of use, ease of
learning, user satisfaction, and evolutionary design.

# Objectives:
• Explain the n-tier architectures and demonstrate how they are
utilized in building the enterprise web applications.
• Recognize and analyze the core elements of the enterprise Web
application architectures
• Acquire the technical skills to utilize technologies used in the analysis,
design, and development of the enterprise web applications
• Utilize the MVC architectural pattern in the design and development
of the component-based and object-oriented web applications.
• Explain the impact of relational, document-oriented and graph
database technologies on the enterprise web applications
development and architectures
• Extract, transform and load real-time and near real-time data from
different data sources for the creation of the data analytics reports
• Compare and contrast the full-stack development frameworks and
technologies
• Build and deploy cloud-native microservices
• Apply UX laws, including Fitts’s law, Jakob’s law, and Hick’s law, for
building products and experiences that are more intuitive and
human-centered.
• Utilize the agile and iterative development processes for scenario-
based usability engineering.
• Organizing the Content of Information Architecture and Application
Structure
• Compare and contrast User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI)
design patterns.
